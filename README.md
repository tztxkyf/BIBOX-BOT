# BIBOX-BOT
- BIBOX is a platform for Cryptocurrency trading. This is sample code for bibox trading api.  
- As there is not official python code, I wrote my own. The original api is JAVA, here rewrite in python.
- It is based on [bibox api v3](https://biboxcom.github.io/v3/spot/zh/#api-2)

# Risk Notice
- Use at your own risk.  
- There is risk from platform itself.  
- Investment in Cryptocurrency (including but not limited to BTC, USDT, ETH, etc) are highly risky.  

# Files
- [bibox_utils.py](https://github.com/tztxkyf/BIBOX-BOT/blob/main/bibox_utils.py) contains some useful functions, like requesting k-line, checking account details, add order, cancel order, etc.  
- [strategy1.py](https://github.com/tztxkyf/BIBOX-BOT/blob/main/strategy1.py) is a sample strategy showing usage of the functions.  

# Dependency
- See imports. It's simple so I did not prepare requirements file.
